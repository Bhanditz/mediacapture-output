      <p>This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that let a Web application manage how audio is rendered on the user audio output devices.</p>

      <p>This document is not complete. It is subject to major changes and,
      while early experimentations are encouraged, it is therefore not
      intended for implementation.</p>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a
      single product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces
      that it contains.</p>

      <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may
      be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
      (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are
      intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

      <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
      this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
      ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
      this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>
